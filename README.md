## What is this?

NPTEL Quiz Memorizer is a simple platform designed to help students memorize quiz answers more efficiently. Rather than just reading through past questions and answers, this interactive tool helps you practice and retain information better.

## ⚡ Key Features

- **Active Practice Testing**: Answer questions actively instead of just reading answers
- **Instant Feedback**: See exactly when and why you choose wrong options
- **Exam-Aligned Content**: Practice with questions that mirror actual NPTEL theory exams
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your improvement and identify weak areas

## How to Use

1. Select the NPTEL course's Week you want to practice
2. Start answering questions and track your progress
3. Review your results to identify areas that need more attention

## Why I Created This

As a student taking NPTEL courses myself, I found that regular practice with quiz questions significantly improved my retention and overall performance. I built this tool to help my batchmates and myself prepare more effectively for NPTEL assessments.
