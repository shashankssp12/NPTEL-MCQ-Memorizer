## What is this?

NPTEL Quiz Memorizer is a simple platform designed to help students memorize quiz answers more efficiently. Rather than just reading through past questions and answers, this interactive tool helps you practice and retain information better.

## Why I Created This

As a student taking NPTEL courses myself, I found that regular practice with quiz questions significantly improved my retention and overall performance. I built this tool to help my batchmates and myself prepare more effectively for NPTEL assessments.
